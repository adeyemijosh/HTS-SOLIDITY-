A token built on the hedera token service,
this code shows the token contract built in solidity and the deploy script in "deploy.js", which creates the token and getting its token Id,
associates the token with an account, thesame account that deploys the token.
Also a transfer feature was also given to the contract to enable it to be sent from one account to another.
